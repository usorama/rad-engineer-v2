# GLOBAL SCOPE (Immutable Project Context)

vision: |
  Autonomous Engineering Platform that can engineer digital solutions from
  ideation to production and beyond, fully autonomously using Claude Code
  and Claude Agent SDK.

ui_integration_objective: |
  Integrate rad-engineer backend (91% complete, 20/22 components) with
  Auto-Claude UI (276 React components) to expose VAC verification,
  decision learning, /plan workflow, and /execute dashboard to users.

critical_issues:
  - issue_1: "Initialization button fails silently (GeneralSettings.tsx:65)"
  - issue_2: "127+ 'Auto-Claude' references throughout codebase"
  - issue_3: "0% rad-engineer features exposed in UI (VAC, learning, /plan, /execute)"

architecture_constraints:
  max_parallel_agents: "2-3 per wave"
  quality_gates: "bun test only, flock serialization"
  context_management: "GLOBAL/TASK/LOCAL, compact at 70%"
  tdd_protocol: "Write test first, verify with evidence"
  vac_protocol: "Pre/post conditions, invariants per story"
  memory_keeper: "Checkpoints per wave, saves per story"

target_capabilities:
  - hierarchical_memory: "GLOBAL/TASK/LOCAL scopes"
  - vac_verification: "Contract-first UI components"
  - decision_learning_ui: "Charts, patterns, timeline"
  - plan_workflow_ui: "Intake → Research → Generate → Approve"
  - execute_dashboard_ui: "Waves, agents, quality gates, recovery"

# TASK SCOPE (Current Execution State)

objective: |
  Execute UI integration plan using /execute skill with TDD protocol,
  wave-based orchestration, and memory-keeper MCP for cross-session context.
