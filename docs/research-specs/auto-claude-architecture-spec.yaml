  value_proposition:
    - "Auto-Claude's UI (8.5/10 reusability) + rad-engineer's intelligence"
    - "10x UX improvement (CLI → desktop app)"
    - "Proven Python plugins save 150 hours rebuild effort"
    - "Incremental delivery reduces risk"

# ============================================================================
# KEY INSIGHTS
# ============================================================================

insights:
  complementary_strengths:
    auto_claude: "UX excellence (Kanban, terminals, roadmap, insights chat)"
    rad_engineer: "Intelligence (decision learning, BMAD reasoning, deterministic execution)"

  hybrid_is_optimal:
    reason: "TypeScript core (maintainable) + Python plugins (proven, expensive to rebuild)"
    architecture: "rad-engineer WaveOrchestrator → spawn Python subprocesses for hard capabilities"

  integration_is_feasible:
    evidence: "78 tasks defined, 32 codebase files already reference auto-claude"
    risk: "Medium (IPC surface mismatch, data format incompatibility managed via adapters)"
