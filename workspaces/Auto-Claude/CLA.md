## 1. Definitions

**"You" (or "Your")** means the individual who submits a Contribution to the Project.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, the Project. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of discussing and improving the Project.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project Owner and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

- Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works
- Sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third parties

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project Owner and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Project to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

## 4. Future Licensing Flexibility

You understand and agree that the Project Owner may, in the future, license the Project, including Your Contributions, under additional licenses beyond the current GNU Affero General Public License version 3.0 (AGPL-3.0). Such additional licenses may include commercial or enterprise licenses.

This provision ensures the Project has proper licensing flexibility should such licensing options be introduced in the future. The open source version of the Project will continue to be available under AGPL-3.0.

## 5. Representations

You represent that:

(a) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the Project.

(b) Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

(c) Your Contribution does not violate any third-party rights, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or contractual obligations.

## 6. Support and Warranty Disclaimer

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all.

UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, YOU PROVIDE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 7. No Obligation to Use

You understand that the decision to include Your Contribution in any project or source repository is entirely at the discretion of the Project Owner, and this Agreement does not guarantee that Your Contributions will be included in any product.

## 8. Contributor Rights

You retain full copyright ownership of Your Contributions. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to prohibit you from licensing Your Contributions under different terms to third parties or from using Your Contributions for any other purpose.

## 9. Notification

You agree to notify the Project Owner of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
