### Impact Assessment

## 2. User Context

### User Personas

## 3. Scope Definition

### MVP Definition
- [ ] What is the absolute minimum to solve the core problem?
- [ ] What features are must-have vs. nice-to-have?
- [ ] Can we launch without [specific feature]?
- [ ] What is the "walking skeleton" of this feature?
- [ ] What can be deferred to phase 2?

### Out of Scope
- [ ] What will we explicitly NOT build?
- [ ] What edge cases will we NOT handle initially?
- [ ] Which user segments will NOT be supported?
- [ ] What integrations are out of scope?

### Technical Risks
- [ ] What is the most technically uncertain part?
- [ ] Have we built something like this before?
- [ ] What third-party dependencies are we taking on?
- [ ] What could cause this to fail technically?
- [ ] Do we need to prototype or spike anything first?

- [ ] Who has final approval on design?
- [ ] Who has final approval on launch?
- [ ] Who can change scope mid-project?
- [ ] What is the escalation path for blockers?

### Communication
- [ ] Who needs to be informed of progress?
- [ ] What is the preferred communication cadence?
- [ ] What format do stakeholders prefer (demos, reports, etc.)?

## Usage Guidelines

### Discovery Session Flow
1. Start with Business Context to establish "why"
2. Move to User Context to understand "who"
3. Define Scope to clarify "what"
4. Explore Technical Context for "how"
5. Confirm Timeline & Resources for "when"
6. Validate with Stakeholder Context

### Tips for Effective Discovery
- Ask open-ended questions first, then drill down
- Always ask "Why?" at least 3 times (5 Whys technique)
- Document assumptions explicitly
- Identify what you don't know (unknown unknowns)
- Validate answers with multiple stakeholders
- Look for conflicting answers as signals of ambiguity

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Vague success criteria ("make it better")
- Solution-first thinking without problem definition
- Missing stakeholder alignment
- Unrealistic timeline expectations
- No clear user research or data
- Scope creep indicators ("while we're at it...")
