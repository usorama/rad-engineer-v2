  WaveOrchestrator coordinates wave-based execution of agent tasks with:
  - Sequential/parallel wave execution
  - Dependency management between tasks
  - Resource limit enforcement via ResourceManager

## Quick Research Findings

From codebase analysis:

**CLAIM-001**: Wave execution pattern executes tasks in batches of maxConcurrent agents
- Source: `test/core/integration/wave-execution.test.ts`
- Verification: Test shows 10 tasks executed in waves of 2

**CLAIM-002**: Wave size determined by ResourceManager.maxConcurrent
- Source: `rad-engineer/src/core/ResourceManager.ts`
- Verification: ResourceManager enforces max 2-3 concurrent agents

**CLAIM-003**: Waves execute sequentially, tasks within wave execute in parallel
- Source: Wave execution test pattern
- Verification: Test verifies max 2 agents active at once

## Next Steps
- Create component-spec.yaml
- Create test-spec.yaml
- Validate and implement
